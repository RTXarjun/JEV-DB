Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is an important cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. It is a mosquito-borne flavivirus and belongs to the same genus as dengue, Zika, yellow fever and West Nile viruses. Japanese Encephalitis Virus belongs to the family Flaviviridae and genus Flavivirus and its mode of infection is a zoonotic cycle between the vector i.e. Culex mosquitos, the amplifying host  is pigs and, the reservoir host is wading birds. Other animals, including humans, horses, etc. are incidental dead end hosts due to low and short-lived viraemia of JEV and hence can get infected but are unable to transmit the virus along to another transmission vector. Due to its prevalence in South-East Asia and the Western Pacific, JEV has been described as “a plague of the orient”. These regions have large rural agricultural and peri-urban settings where rice farming occurs which is a breeding ground for mosquitoes and there is also a decent pig/water fowl population. Seasonal transmission occurs which varies with monsoon rains and irrigation practices. The first case of JEV was documented in Japan in 1871. In 1935, the Nakayama strain prototype was isolated from the brain of a patient for the first time. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), major outbreaks of JEV occur every 2-15 years and transmission intensifies during monsoons as the vector population increases and is seen in agricultural areas and intensive rice cultivation. After an outbreak, measures are taken to reduce mosquito infestation and quarantine pig farms, but the virus remains dormant until the next ideal monsoon season and negligence of the people and hence the outbreak reoccurs. Since 1955, many major outbreaks have been recorded in India, for example, Bankura in 1973, and Gorakhpur in 1978, etc.. JEV exists as one phenotype and five distinguishable genotypes – G-I, G-II, G-III, G-IV and G-V – based on nucleotide homology in the E protein gene; three subtypes (a, b and c) are also distinguishable within G-I. Most of the JEV strains isolated in India belong to genotype III and sometimes genotype II. However, JEV genotype I, has recently been reported in human patients from Gorakhpur.The annual incidence of clinical disease varies both across and within endemic countries, ranging from 10 per 100 000 population or higher during outbreaks. A literature review and modelling study estimates about 100 000 clinical cases (95% CI: 61 720–157 522) of JE globally each year, with approximately 25 000 deaths (95% CI: 14 550–46 031). JE primarily affects children. Most adults in endemic countries have natural immunity after childhood infection, but individuals of any age may be affected.
