          Prior to 2021, only 5 cases reported, including from Outer Torres Strait Islands and Far North Queensland (1995–1998).<br>
          In 2021–2022, 45 cases reported from widespread areas, with outbreak focused in rural areas surrounding Murray River; no further cases reported in 2023 but cases reported again from December 2024.<br>
          Most travelers at very low risk as no transmission risk in main tourist areas; vaccination recommended for longer-term (≥1 month) travel to key risk areas.
