                Several molecular methods have been described and tested for detection of Japanese encephalitis virus by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Molecular assays compatible for application directly in the field where there is limited availability of equipments have been developed. Parida et al., 2006 described the reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the above purpose. Multiplex assays involving detection and differentiation of a wide range of viruses along with Japanese encephalitis virus has acquired greater interest. Whole genome sequencing techniques have been able to provide a more thorough genetic identification of the virus along with their geographical origin. The molecular techniques are highly specific. However, they simultaneously require highly skilled personnel for their proper execution and also involve high cost in terms of the various equipments, chemicals and primers used.</p>
