            <p style="font-family: dm sans; font-size: 20px;"> The detection of JEV infection is problematic due to the short duration of viraemia and the asymptomatic nature of infection. These factors present a challenge for obtaining a definitive diagnosis of JEV infection or for establishing prevalence levels in livestock populations. Another major challenge in choosing a diagnostic technique is the specificity of the test due to cross-reactivity between flavivirus. Therefore, diagnosis relies on the use of a combination of clinical, serological and pathological tests.</p>

            <p style="font-family: dm sans; font-size: 20px;">
                One of the most common kit based diagnostic techniques to detect JEV is by the detection of IgM and IgG virus-specific antibodies using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) techniques. Both commercially patented ELISA kits as well as ‘In-house’ ELISA assays are widely used for JE diagnosis. IgM antibodies are detectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as well as serum within 7 days of the onset of the disease (WHO, 2006) and hence are most commonly used for JEV diagnosis as they can be used for the identification of recent acute cases of JEV. A number of published in-house ELISAs have been described, including ELISAs for the detection of virus-specific IgM and IgG antibodies in CSF, an indirect IgG ELISA to study the seasonal sero prevalence of JEV, and an indirect ELISA (basic schematic shown in Figure 5.) for prevalence studies of JE-specific antibodies in pigs .</p>

             <p style="font-family: dm sans; font-size: 20px;">The most common form of definitive diagnosis even today, especially in horses, relies upon the isolation of the complete virus (20, 21) from central nervous system (CNS) tissue of diseased or dead animals. This however has its limitations due to virus instability under certain conditions as well as the effect of host antibodies. The World Health Organization for Animal Health has provided a list of different techniques which may be used for the conclusive diagnosis of JEV (Office International des Epizooties – OIE) (OIE, 2012).
             
             Isolation of the complete Japanese Encephalitis (JE) virus can be done both using in vitro techniques or by the inoculation of mice (38). BSL-3 protection is a must when dealing with isolation of JEV virus to avoid the risk of human infection. JEV can be isolated from different sections of the brain such the corpus striatum, cortex or thalamus as well as from the spinal cord and blood. Since JEV infects the CNS, brain sections are the most preferred source for virus isolation followed by spinal cord and blood.
             
             For in-vitro isolation of the virus, primary cell cultures can be prepared from chicken embryos, porcine or hamster kidney cells, or tissue culture can also be performed on established cell lines such as C6/36 (mosquito – Aedes albopictus), BHK (baby hamster kidney) or Vero (African green monkey kidney). On incubation with JEV, the mammalian cells get lysed by JEV infection and a gel overlay can be used to restrict the virus from spreading in a cell sheet. Using a cell dye such as crystal violet, individual plaques formed can be visualized.
             
             For in vivo isolation of the virus, 2–4 day old mice are inoculated with a homogenate of CNS tissue taken from an infected animal intracerebrally. If the diagnostic sample is positive for JEV, the mice will exhibit neurological signs and die within 14 days, usually with convulsions just before death. Mice showing severe infection should be euthanized. Once dead, the brain of the mice is removed and JEV can be isolated and identified using cell culture techniques. Further confirmation of the isolated JE virus is done using subsequent serological and molecular tests.

             <P style="font-size: 20px;">Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays provide sen-sitivity and speciﬁcity equivalent to that of conventional PCRcombined with Southern blot analysis, and since ampliﬁca-tion and detection steps are performed in the same closedvessel, the risk of releasing ampliﬁed nucleic acids into theenvironment is negligible. In general, both PCR and ampli-ﬁed product detection are completed within an hour or less,which is considerably faster than conventional PCR detec-tion methods. By reverse transcriptase PCR, the viral g enomecan be ampliﬁed directly from tissue or blood.15,65Anovelnested reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based kit is described for detecting JEV, in which allreagents are lyophilized in reaction tubes and control RNA isincluded in each reaction to monitor false negative results.66Another study described and evaluated a reverse transcrip-tion loop-mediated isothermal ampliﬁcation (RT-LAMP) assayfor detecting JEV. The sensitivity of the JEV RT-LAMP assaywas in concordance with that real-time RT-PCR, and it wasmore sensitive than that of conventional RT-PCR. The JEV RT-LAMP was highly speciﬁc; no cross-reactivity was found withdengue-2 virus, rabies virus, norovirus, astrovirus, and humanenterovirus 71. The JEV RT-LAMP assay was simpler and lesstime-consuming compared to the conventional RT-PCR andreal-time RT-PCR. The results suggest that the RT-LAMP assaycan be applied as a practical molecular diagnostic tool for JEVinfection and surveillance.</P>
