    Progress has been made in Asia with the implementation of JE vaccination programmes, with most endemic countries having country-wide or targeted programmes in place.  A decline in incidence of the disease has been reported in recent years, which is likely due in part to vaccination. Gavi supports JE catch-up campaigns and co-finances the vaccine for routine immunization in eligible countries.
    
    Safe and effective JE vaccines are available to prevent disease. WHO recommends having strong JE prevention and control activities, including JE immunization in all regions where the disease is a recognized public health priority, along with strengthening surveillance and reporting mechanisms. Even if the number of JE-confirmed cases is low, vaccination should be considered where there is a suitable environment for JE virus transmission. Introduction of the vaccine should be done in conjunction with a one-time catch-up campaign.
    
    There are three main types of JE vaccines currently in use: several inactivated Vero cell-derived vaccines, a live attenuated vaccine, and a live recombinant (chimeric) vaccine. One inactivated vaccine and the two live vaccines are WHO prequalified.</p><hr>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;"> risk to travellers to Japanese encephalitis-endemic areas is normally low, but travellers should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites. Personal preventive measures include the use of mosquito repellents, long-sleeved clothes, coils and vaporizers. Travellers spending extensive time in JE endemic areas are recommended to get vaccinated before travel.
    
    In endemic areas, there is little evidence to support a reduction in JE disease burden from interventions other than the vaccination of humans. Thus, vaccination of humans should be prioritized over vaccination of pigs and mosquito control measures. However, the spread of JEV in new areas has been correlated with agricultural development and intensive rice cultivation supported by irrigation programmes.</p>
