        Booster doses
    </h2>
</center>
    <p>
        A booster dose (third dose) should be given at ≥1 year after completion of the primary IXIARO series if ongoing exposure or re-exposure to JE virus is expected. A study showed that at approximately 6 years after a booster dose, 96% of persons were still protected.

Limited data are available on the use of IXIARO as a booster dose after a primary series with the mouse brain-derived inactivated JE vaccine. Three studies have been conducted, 2 in U.S. military personnel and the other at 2 travel clinics in Europe. Results indicated that among adults who had previously received at least a primary series of mouse brain-derived inactivated JE vaccine, a single dose of IXIARO provided good protection through 12–23 months.

        Safety and adverse reactions
    </h2>
</center>
    <p>
        Among adults, the most common local reactions are pain and tenderness, reported in about one-third of adults after the first or second dose, and the most common systemic reactions are headache (approximately 28%) and myalgia (approximately 16%). In children, the most common systemic reaction is fever, with higher rates (>20%) in children aged 2 months–2 years compared with older children and adolescents. Serious adverse events are reported only rarely.
